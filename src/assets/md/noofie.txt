#### Problem
Networking has always been a shared fear among young professionals. Noofie is an app aimed to make I focused on this problem as an independent project for my final project at GA, using design to provide a solution to make entry-level networking easier.
Specifically, I identified 3 issues:
1.  The gap between expectations in school vs. workplace
2.  Learning job search and interview-specific strategies can be overwhelming
3.  It is hard for people with little experience to build a mutually beneficial professional relationship
#### Early Concepts & Competitive research
I started with a strategic mind map to gather my thoughts and see the overall strategic direction.

In this map, I identified the 3 issues I mentioned above (top left), listed a few competitors and their respective niche (top right), some ideas for the product & team culture, and a few business analyses like SWOT, PEST and ERRC. I looked at a few channels that young professionals were using for the job search process: LinkedIn, Glassdoor, alumni & various communities...
Through this exercise, I formed a better idea of the problem space and found that there are indeed opportunities on the market for entry level networking/mentorship that I could specialize in.
Next I wanted to how my skill set in design could play in.
#### Expert Interviews
I reached out to 4 young professionals who didn’t mind networking and asked them about their success l to find out if I could leverage design to replicate their experience. I also researched online guides for how young professionals can network.
From their insights and the online guides, I realized that young professionals are more likely to receive help from each other, so I decided to narrow my target user base toward only people in early stages of their career.
I also found that when students received help through networking, they reported helping other students when they became professionals themselves. Thus, I thought I could build a community for mentorship. I interviewed another friend who's been in industry for ~5 years and loves mentoring, to gather insight on what being a mentor meant.
#### Strategy & Scope
From these interviews, I found that a successful early stage professional network has the following characteristics, which could be transferred into features in my community:
[img]
-   1-on-1 and face-2-face => messaging & scheduling offline meetings
-   The receiver has a specific goal, but also has something they can offer in return => Ask & Offer as profile field
-   The giver, although less active in the process, should be equally invested in the relationship => mutual selection process
-   People play both the role of helper and receiver in different networking relationships => letting people have both experiences in one platform
-   Consistent follow up process to encourage development of long term relationship => follow up features
I realized that a lot of these criterion sounded familiar, such as in dating.
I thought of Coffee Meets Bagel, a Tinder-like dating app that recognizes the difference in dating habits/needs between different genders(gender related social issues aside) and provides a good design solution.
The two-type user distinction is similar to the mentor vs mentee problem I was facing. Furthermore, despite professional networks usually being considered "weak relationships," developing long term mentorship is often times a “bonus” goal. And my target demographic should already be familiar with a tinder-like mobile experience.
Some features I learned from CMB were:
[img]
-   2-role user system: drawing a clear line between giver & receiver. The mentors select their potential mentees first, so mentees can select from the pool of mentors knowing they will more likely follow through
-   Limited matches per day: since we value the quality of connections over quantity, matches are limited per day to not overwhelm users, and also encourage them to value each potential connection more. (Also helps with retention & can be a revenue stream)
-   Tinder-like interface: a familiar, casual & efficient ways to express interest in people
#### Personas
At this point I feel like I had a good grasp of what the app would look like, and I was ready to dive deeper into specifics.
To gain insight about my audience, I set up 3 personas based on my experience job searching since I began college. These 3 users form an ideal network for my app, with Sindy being my primary targeted user: most in need of our service, and can benefit from both user profiles we offer r.

#### User Flow
Based on my 3 personas, I wrote down what each of them could do on our app with the
When I want to …, I … so I ...
method and wove together a user flow.

Through this step, I determined what screens and features I should have for my app, and their relationships to each other.
#### Wireframes, Prototypes & Iterations
From the flow map, I constructed the structure of the app. Then, I designed the wireframe based on familiar interaction patterns. I chose to follow the iOS guidelines for simplicity. Apps I drew inspirations from included dating apps (for connecting), messaging apps (for communication), and calendar apps (for scheduling).
I went through 5 usability tests as I iterated my wireframes and prototypes from paper to digital.

With feedback, I was able to include an onboarding flow. Even though users had no trouble understanding all the interfaces, they still had trouble developing a mental framework of the networking process. Thus, I decided to put this meta-information in an onboarding flow, and they were able to make sense of all the steps quickly.

I also improved some smaller interaction patterns. During testing, I observed that users would pause during certain interactions to try to understand what was going on. So I tweaked these interactions to be more familiar, and observed smoother interactions in the next iteration.

#### Look & Feel
Overall, I wanted the branding to be professional and trustworthy, but also fun and energetic for the younger audience. The brand was named from the companion dog breed - Newfoundlands, and our product should be just like the dog - reliable at working, but also good companion.
I started off with creating a color palette, and chose the "professional" blue to be the primary color, with a navy tone (noofie is a water breed!). Drawing further inspiration from the name, I chose brown (the color of the pup) to be the accent color. For other colors such as alert and warning, I kept them vibrant but tuned down brightness to create a fun but subtle look.

For the logo, I decided to go with type as for temporary use. I chose a bold but rounded font, and a thinner version for body texts, again, for a casual-reliable feel.
#### Bonus
To build the prototype, I learned Swift for iOS. For the card animation I used the MDCSwipeToChoose class from github. The on-launch screen was built within a week.

To spread the hype, I created a quick website on Wix. I mostly used default stock graphics, while keeping in mind the “fun & professional” feel. The site introduces the app’s purpose, how it works, why it’s different, and features multiple call to actions that lead to the beta sign up.

The pitch deck featured some key strategic decisions of the app in the overall problem space following the same visual style, where I reiterated what the problem was and how my design provides the solution.

##### Looking Back & Forward
This project ended as school started again and as I was overcoming some personal issues (with a gap semester to China).
Since this app encompassed both an online and offline experience, the most important thing I would’ve done next was to prototype the full experience including the offline interactions, and to see its effectiveness in achieving my design goal. I also would like to validate more assumptions I had to make throughout the process, including my 3 issues themselves.
Nevertheless, I learned a lot about design going through the full process from idea to prototype, as well as creating the “side-products,” like a pitch deck and website, and how a design fits in the business landscape.
