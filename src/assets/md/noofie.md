#### Early Concepts & Competitive research
I started with a strategic mind map to gather my thoughts and see the overall strategic direction.

In this map, I identified the 3 issues I mentioned above (top left), listed a few competitors and their respective niche (top right), some ideas for the product & team culture, and a few business analyses like SWOT, PEST and ERRC. I looked at a few channels that young professionals were using for the job search process: LinkedIn, Glassdoor, alumni & various communities...
Through this exercise, I formed a better idea of the problem space and found that there are indeed opportunities on the market for entry level networking/mentorship that I could specialize in.
Next I wanted to how my skill set in design could play in.

#### Expert Interviews
I reached out to 4 young professionals who didn’t mind networking and asked them about their success l to find out if I could leverage design to replicate their experience. I also researched online guides for how young professionals can network.
From their insights and the online guides, I realized that young professionals are more likely to receive help from each other, so I decided to narrow my target user base toward only people in early stages of their career.
I also found that when students received help through networking, they reported helping other students when they became professionals themselves. Thus, I thought I could build a community for mentorship. I interviewed another friend who's been in industry for ~5 years and loves mentoring, to gather insight on what being a mentor meant.
From these interviews, I found that a successful early stage professional network has the following characteristics, which could be transferred into features in my community:

-   1-on-1 and face-2-face => messaging & scheduling offline meetings
-   The receiver has a specific goal, but also has something they can offer in return => Ask & Offer as profile field
-   The giver, although less active in the process, should be equally invested in the relationship => mutual selection process
-   People play both the role of helper and receiver in different networking relationships => letting people have both experiences in one platform
-   Consistent follow up process to encourage development of long term relationship => follow up features

I realized that a lot of these criterion sounded familiar, such as in dating.
I thought of Coffee Meets Bagel, a Tinder-like dating app that recognizes the difference in dating habits/needs between different genders(gender related social issues aside) and provides a good design solution.
The two-type user distinction is similar to the mentor vs mentee problem I was facing. Furthermore, despite professional networks usually being considered "weak relationships," developing long term mentorship is often times a “bonus” goal. And my target demographic should already be familiar with a tinder-like mobile experience.

Some features I learned from CMB were:
[img]
-   2-role user system: drawing a clear line between giver & receiver. The mentors select their potential mentees first, so mentees can select from the pool of mentors knowing they will more likely follow through
-   Limited matches per day: since we value the quality of connections over quantity, matches are limited per day to not overwhelm users, and also encourage them to value each potential connection more. (Also helps with retention & can be a revenue stream)
-   Tinder-like interface: a familiar, casual & efficient ways to express interest in people
```

#### Personas
At this point I feel like I had a good grasp of what the app would look like, and I was ready to dive deeper into specifics.
To gain insight about my audience, I set up 3 personas based on my experience job searching since I began college. These 3 users form an ideal network for my app, with Sindy being my primary targeted user: most in need of our service, and can benefit from both user profiles we offer r.

#### User Flow
Based on my 3 personas, I wrote down what each of them could do on our app with the

When I want to …, I … so I ...

method and wove together a user flow.

Through this step, I determined what screens and features I should have for my app, and their relationships to each other.
